## Game Results Application (CS50W Capstone Project)

My Game Results app helps friends who play offline games together like board games or casual sport to keep track of the results of their games and see how they stack up against each other with a ranking system.

Users can add their favourite games, update their recent scores and track
how they're doing against other players. There is also an overall ranking, 
which compares all players across all games to see who is the ultimate
game champion!

### How this app meets the project requirements

This app has several features making it more complex than previous projects, including:
 - Implementation of Microsoft Research's TrueSkill Bayesian inference system for the Game Result Application's player rating system. After at least 3 results have been added for a game, the rating system will start to calculate player ratings. This system quantifies playersâ€™ skill points using a Bayesian inference algorithm. The more games that are played, the more accurate the rankings become.
 - A JavaScript API handling the form validation for the 'Submit Results' form

This application utilises Django with 4 models on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.

All parts of this web application are mobile-responsive.
